# eshu-collector-gcp-cloud

**Status: pre-release.** Eshu core still owns this data in
production. This repo has no authority to publish facts on its own
yet.

In a nutshell: this collector reads Google Cloud asset data and
hands Eshu evidence about what exists in a scope, how those
resources relate, and who can access them. Eshu can then answer
which Google Cloud resources it has seen and how they connect.
The collector only collects and returns evidence; it doesn't
store anything itself.

In text: Google Cloud (or a fixture file) -> this collector ->
Eshu host process -> Eshu core.

## When to use it

Use it when Eshu needs evidence about Google Cloud resources under
one organization, folder, or project, including their
relationships, tags, DNS records, image references, and IAM
policies and identities.

## When not to use it

- Don't use it as a live Google Cloud browser or reporting tool.
  It returns facts to the Eshu host; it has no user interface.
- Don't mix credentials in one activation.
  Scopes that name different `credential_ref` values fail closed.
- Don't use it for other clouds or for Google Cloud data-plane
  contents (object data, secrets, or record payloads).

## How Eshu runs it

The host runs one claim per process invocation.
It starts `./collector --sdk-stdio`, writes one
`collector-sdk/v1alpha1` request to stdin, and reads one result
from stdout. The host owns admission and storage; this binary
never commits facts itself.

## Documentation

Start at the [docs index](docs/README.md). Shortcuts people use most:

| Page | What you'll find there |
|---|---|
| [Getting started](docs/getting-started/README.md) | Run it once, see facts come back |
| [Configuration](docs/reference/configuration.md) | Every config field, credentials, and the claim budget |
| [Facts](docs/reference/facts.md) | The fact kinds it emits, mirroring the manifest |
| [Diagrams](docs/diagrams/README.md) | Every diagram, with captions and text versions |
